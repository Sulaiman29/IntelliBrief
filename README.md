# IntelliBrief News Summarization Project
The objective of our project is to develop a robust news summarization system capable of
efficiently processing large volumes of news articles and producing concise and coherent
summaries. By combining data science techniques with NLP algorithms, we aim to create a
system that can extract information from news articles across different domains and deliver
informative summaries.

### Project Goals
Create a robust news summarization system using NLP and Data Science.

Classify news articles into 5 categories (Business, Entertainment, Politics, Sport, Tech).

Generate summaries using NLP techniques (CBOW, Skip-Gram, Graph-based methods).

Evaluate using Naive Bayes and Decision Trees classifiers, and ROUGE metrics.

### Plan:
* Week1 - Initial Setup and Data Collection/Preprocessing
* Week2 - Feature Extraction & Model Preparation
* Week3 - Model Training and Evaluation
* Week4 - Integration, Final Testing, and Documentation
